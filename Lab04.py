    Insert your code to print out the lines to the 99 bottles song

    point for the number of bottles.

    Remember that each "verse" should take 4 lines, and then
    a blank link should be printed between verses. 

    You can delete the below "pass" once you add some code. It is just
    here to stop syntax errors until you've added actual code to
    this function.
