# Lab 04 - Troubleshooting
![](https://github.com/<user_info>/workflows/Autotesting/badge.svg)

You are tasked with fixing the two scripts included in this repository.

Instructions for what both scripts are doing are included in the overall lab instructions.

Fix both locally on your own system after downloading the repository and then upload them back to Github to get credit for the day.

Autotesting is running on these, so you will be able to check them just like with your homework!
