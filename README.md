# Lab 04 - Loops!

The goal for this lab is to print out the lyrics to the "99 bottles of beer on the wall" song using both a while loop method and a for loop method. More details in the instructions.

No autotesting on this lab, since it is a bit open-ended and flexible in its presentation. Just make sure both functions are printing out the same lyrics!
